## Course Overview

In the morning, students will attend lectures that cover the core material and provide foundational understanding of the dayâ€™s topics.

In the afternoon, students will engage in hands-on learning activities designed to reinforce the concepts introduced earlier: *problem sheets* or *small projects*

We're going to maintain a supportive, exploratory environment suited for motivated high school learners.

---


## Prerequisites and Expected Background

*This is not an introductory programming course.*

Students are expected to enter the course with *prior programming experience* equivalent to at least one of the following:

* Completion of **AP Computer Science A**
* Completion of a full-year **high school computer science course**
* Independent programming experience in Python or a similar language

---

#### Prereqs 

* Writing and debugging programs in *Python* or another programming language
* Using and defining *functions*
* Understanding *control flow* (conditionals, loops)
* Working with *classes and objects*
* Using *basic data structures* (lists, dictionaries, arrays)
* Reading and reasoning about code written by others

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Write functional Python programs from scratch
* Use graphical libraries to represent visual models
* Implement graph algorithms and game strategies
* Understand and simulate discrete probabilistic systems
* Design basic AI agents to solve strategic board games
* Fetch and serve data using web APIs
* Build and present a complete software system integrating core concepts



---

## Grading and Evaluation

- Students will receive ongoing feedback and mentorship, and are encouraged to focus on *creativity, collaboration, and growth.*

- Assignments will be evaluated on a three part scale:
  - **Exemplary**, for absolutely outstanding work. 
  - **Satisfactory**, for most work of acceptable correctness & effort
  - **Unsatisfactory**, for work that does not meet the expected level of correctness and effort.

## Expectations and Conduct

Students are expected to:

- Attend all scheduled lectures and labs
- Participate actively in class discussions and activities
- Collaborate respectfully with peers and staff
- Complete their own project work and original code

The course encourages creative experimentation and peer collaboration. However, all final projects must reflect individual or team-authored code.

---


## Other Classroom Rules

- Be on time arriving to class at 9am and 1:30pm every day.
- When seats/groups are assigned, please sit in those assigned locations.
- Get our permission before leaving the classroom for any reason.
- In order to promote a positive and growth-oriented classroom environment, we will assign work that can be completed mostly during class time. Additionally, we will accept work on best-effort rather than perfect correctness. But if we observe that students are not providing good effort, we will resort to stricter standads.
